# AdvPrPar

This repository contains the code written during the course _AdvPrPar (Advanced Programming Paradigm)_, MSE 2016-2017. AdvPrPar aims at familiarizing the students with FP programming using Scala.
 
Course material (theory and exercises) is available in [`pdfs`](pdfs). The material is the hard work of @ professor Pierre-Andr√© Mudry, so please don't use them outside of personal use without asking him.

The repository contains one folder per course, with both code from the course and the exercise serie. It has been done thoroughly but without sharing in mind (so you won't find many comments).
